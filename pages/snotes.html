                <h5 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey"><b>Backstory</b></h5>
<p>
This was a program i decided to make because of a hole in the software supply (that or my poor googling skills). This was during my placement year, when i met so many new people that I struggled to keep track of all of them. So i felt the need to keep notes of these professional relationships just for the purpose of small talk before meetings or coffee breaks.
<br>
But doing so is very chaotic if done through simple notes. So i used my coding superpowers to make the process more efficient. The use case scenario would be:
1. type the name of the person
2. Type the associated note
3. Move on with the day
<br>
When reviewing notes, I’d go to an online spreadsheet and my program would have filtered and organised everything by person (or could be other things, i could have a record called groceries where i put groceries notes).
<br>
This is useful because if i have a 9 am meeting in the morning with John from Accounting, i can pop up John on my spreadsheet and see what we talked about last time.
</p>
<h5 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey"><b>Geeky Stuff</b></h5>
<p>
Again, very lightweight. Google Apps Scripts are great! You can whip up a program in seconds from any computer in the world, no databases, no html. The spreadsheet is your database, you can change it manually or programmatically, love it.
<br>
What my script does is listen to a specific form (where I type John and write out the related note) and update a spreadsheet. That’s pretty much it, the rest is just the program logic.

<h5 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey"><b>Thoughts</b></h5>
<p>
If i didn’t have such a tool, I wouldn’t even have bothered with this whole thing. But since all it took was something like 100 lines of code, the value proposition of this project skyrocketed.
<br>
This is useful because is a middle ground between those sophisticated productivity apps and the simple note app on your phone.
